# Supplementary Material for "Extracting Business Process Activities from Domain-Specific Emails using Large Language Models"

This repository contains anonymized representative examples used for the qualitative evaluation in our CAiSE 2025 submission.

## Included Material
For each case (UC-1, UC-2, UC-3) we provide:
- The anonymized email text (`email.txt`)
- The gold-standard activity annotations (`gold.json`)
- The GPT-4o extraction output (`llm_gpt4o.json`)
- The frequent-pattern extraction output (`rule_based.txt`)

These cases illustrate typical success and error behaviors of the evaluated approaches.

## Confidentiality Note
We do not release the full dataset due to confidentiality agreements with the data provider. Only selected anonymized excerpts are shared to support transparency of the evaluation.
